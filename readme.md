Things are shaping up.

- Got some good objects and inheritence going on. No proper implementation of super but this will work for now and is a nice demonstration of the prototypal inheritence.

- Renamed the base object to be more semantic and what the immovable object inherits from.

- Wandering is still in progress, with thte added inheritance I increaded the dubbging rendering, it is close, with the add debugging it should be easy to figure out.

- Once I have all that in a nice place Ill add the build system and make it cleaner experience, not all these separate pages.
